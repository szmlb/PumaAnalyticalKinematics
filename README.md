# Introduction
This repository provides minimal python implementation of an analytical forward/inverse kinematics for industrial 6-axis manipulator.
The implementation is based on the paper, "An Analytical Solution of the Inverse Kinematics Problem of Industrial Serial Manipulators with an Ortho-parallel Basis and a Spherical Wrist", authored by Mathias Brandst√∂tter, Arthur Angerer, and Michael Hofbaur.

# Notes
The code is under development.
